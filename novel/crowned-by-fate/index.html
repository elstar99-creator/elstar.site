    <h2>Blurb</h2>
    <p>
        She was forced to marry the cold and distant King — a man who rejected her heart before the vows were even spoken. 
        In a kingdom where love is weakness and loyalty is a weapon, she is treated as nothing but a pawn in a game of power.
        <br><br>
        But fate has other plans.
        <br><br>
        As secrets unfold and alliances shift, the girl once ignored rises from silence. Behind the crown lies a fire no one expected — not even the King who cast her aside.
        <br><br>
        Now he wants what he once threw away...  
        But will she still choose him when she finally learns the truth?
        <br><br>
        A royal romance of betrayal, survival, and a love written in the stars.
